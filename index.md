## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/me3.jpg">

Hi! My name is DongInn Kim. I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Indiana University. My current research focuses on the reverse engineering for the security of IoT devices and building an intelligent dynamic analysis tool on the top of existing static/dynamic analysis security tools. My PhD thesis under the supervision of Prof. Jean Camp is based on developing an intrusion detection system by fingerprinting the accessing edge services and IoT devices with machine learning processes of the collected features.
I work for the IU CSI CTF (Capture The Flag) team and I am also working on
the Open Source Cluster Application Resources
([OSCAR](https://oscar-cluster.github.io/oscar/)) as a core developer. My
research interests include software engineering, clustering computing, and
systems security.

## Research Interest

My current research focuses on the reverse engineering for the security of IoT
devices and building an intelligent dynamic analysis tool on the top of
existing static/dynamic analysis security tools.

### Current Work
- work on the SCGSR Awards in PNNL for the Summer intern: the proposed project is to develop a system to detect the BGP hijacking in the IoT environment.
- mentor an REU student, Eric Swiler for the project of the SSL certification database

### Past Work 
- detect malicious domains from the CH registry database: planning to apply
  machine learning
- binary analysis to investigate any possible penetrations in Intel SGX: working
  with SGX reading group
- [practice](http://iuctf.gitlab.io/notes/) the CTF exercises / problems with
  some various reverse engineering tools (e.g. radare2, unicorn, capstone,
  keystone, ...)
- renovating the security toolbar, which is an extension of Firefox to make web
  browsing more secure.
- work on the "CUTS CertProbe and CertWarehouse" for collecting and compiling
  the Public key
  certificates. <= [Previous work: [PDF](https://iu.box.com/s/tcymb04cebttwlik3dojfm06ovibifkq)]

## Technical Skills

Machine learning (ML) models that I have implmented with [R](https://www.r-project.org/):

Name | What does it do
-----|----------------
[K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) | Unsupervised, non-parametric ML to classify data with the given K value
[E-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm) | Unsupervised, parametric ML to find maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori
[Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression/) | Supervised, parametric ML to find the linear model between given data sets (X,..., Y)
[Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression/) | Supervised, parametric ML to find the categorical model between dependent variables
[KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) | Unsupervised, non-parametric ML for classification and regression
[Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) | Semi-supervised, parametric ML for the probabilistic classifier with the assumption of [IID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables)

Here is the list of the tools that I am currently learning:

Name | What does it do
-----|----------------
[Frida](https://www.frida.re/) | Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for the binary analysis
[Scapy](https://scapy.net/) | Python version of tshark and more
[Radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2) | Reverse engineering framework
[Unicorn](http://iuctf.gitlab.io/notes/unicorn_blog.html) | CPU emulator ([U](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/))
[Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) | Disassembly framework
[Keystone](http://www.keystone-engine.org/) | Assembler framework
[Pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) | GDB plug-in to make debugging with GDB much easier
