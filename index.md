## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me3.jpg">

Hi! My name is DongInn Kim. I am a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science
Department of Indiana University-Bloomington under the guidance of Prof. L Jean
Camp. I work for the IU CSI CTF (Catch The Flag) team and I am also working on
the Open Source Cluster Application Resources
([OSCAR](https://oscar-cluster.github.io/oscar/)) as a core developer. My
research interests include software engineering, clustering computing, and
systems security.

## Research Interest

My current research focuses on the reverse engineering for the security of IoT
devices and building an intelligent dynamic analysis tool on the top of
existing static/dynamic analysis security tools.

### Current work
- renovating the security toolbar, which is an extension of Firefox to make the web browsing more secure.
- work on the "CUTS CertProbe and CertWarehouse" for collecting and compiling the Public key certificates.
